This Webpage highlights my learning of jQuery to create a responsive webpage that can be opened and easy for users to read on a mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop. This also shows my learning and first use of CSS grid to organize and style my webpages. I find it more organized and easier to notice any missing details or mistakes.
